=============================
basic_plone_buildout template
=============================

The basic buildout template creates a simple, no-frills buildout suitable for 
extending in any way the user sees fit.  As it is a buildout, and not an egg,
there are no restrictions on the name provided for the package.  

Create a buildout with a simple name::

    >>> templer('affinitic_basic_plone_buildout mybuild --no-interactive')
    templer affinitic_basic_plone_buildout mybuild --no-interactive
    ...

Let's be sure that the package we just created exists and has the right name::
    >>> ls('.')
    mybuild

The buildout should contain nothing but the bootstrap.py file and a 
buildout.cfg::

    >>> ls('.', 'mybuild')
    bootstrap.py
    buildout.cfg
